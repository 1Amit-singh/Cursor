<p CLASS = "text-white ">A technically proficient winger, with good dribbling, decision making and an appealing and attractive style of play Raphael Dias Belloli (Raphinha) was born on 14 December 1996 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. He joined the Club from Leeds United in summer 2022.
The Brazilian winger went through the youth system at Avaí FC, making his debut for the club at the age of 19. His talent and progression earmarked him for European football and he went on to sign for the Portuguese Primeria Liga side, Vitòria Guimaraes. His first season was spent alternating playing for the youth and first teams before he ended up cementing a starting place.
Two years later, Raphinha signed for Sporting Club de Portugal for the 2018/19 season. The Brazilian developed into one of Europe's promising talents while at the Lisbon club and played a key role in the club winning the Copa de la Liga and Copa de Portugal double.
At the end of the 2018/19 season, Raphinha joined Rennes. He was one of the most expensive signings that summer, and the French club's second most expensive signing ever at the time. The winger played high quality football that season and proved to be the team's main threat.
In summer 2020 Raphinha signed for Leeds United, after his good performances didn't go unnoticed. During his two seasons at the English club he scored 17 goals and created 10 assists. He also played a key role in preventing the team from being relegated from the Premier League during his second year, shining bright towards the end of the 2021/22 season.
A full international level, Raphinha officially debuted for the Brazilian national team on 7 October 2021 against Venezuela, creating two assists in the match. The winger was also part of the Brazil squad in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar where he figured in every game for his national side. </p>
